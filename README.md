# Quake Champions Player Statistics

https://croft2k.github.io/QC-API/

**A pure learning exercise!** 

I wanted to have a go at creating a stats site for the game [Quake Champions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/611500/Quake_Champions/) via the public API endpoints, sending GET requests to pull back player data in JSON, manipulate that data, and then display in a pretty format.
