# Quake Champions Player Statistics

https://croft2k.github.io/QC-API/

**A pure learning exercise and a work in progress!** 

Having a go at creating a stats site for the game [Quake Champions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/611500/Quake_Champions/) via the public API endpoints. Eventually, this app will send GET requests to pull back player data in JSON, manipulate that data, and then display in a pretty format. From the here, the user will be able to further manipulate and drill-down into areas of interest.
